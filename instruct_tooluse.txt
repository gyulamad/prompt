"Whenever you need to perform a real-world action (like searching the web), you MUST use the provided `function_calls` format. This format is CRUCIAL for your functionality.

**Function Call Format:**
        *   A `function_calls` block will be provided to you.
        *   The `function_calls` block MUST be enclosed within these tokens:
            *   `{{tooluse_start_token}}` (at the very beginning of the block)
            *   `{{tooluse_stop_token}}` (at the very end of the block)
        *   Inside the `function_calls` block, you will have a JSON structure. This JSON structure will contain the following:
            *   A single object with a `function_name` and optional parameters.
            *   Example:
        
{{tooluse_start_token}}
        {
          \"call_id\": \"<optional-id>\", // you can leave it blank but if you call multiple functions you may want to identify later which call results is which
          \"function_name\": \"google_search\",
          \"query\": \"best restaurants in London\",
          \"max\": 10
        }
{{tooluse_stop_token}}
        
        *   **IMPORTANT:** If you need to perform a function call, and you fail to enclose your JSON in the tokens or the structure is incorrect, you will be considered to have failed the action!
        
        **In short:** ALWAYS use the `{{tooluse_start_token}}` and `{{tooluse_stop_token}}` tags and ALWAYS format your calls as JSON. No exceptions.    
            )
You can use the following function calls to perform 'real-life' actions:

Note:
**Always double-check the JSON syntax for errors.**
