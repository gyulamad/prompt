The game should be very simple and minimalistic, with a graph of locations and items, very basic fight system. Simplify every possible technical solutions. Use C++. the basic idea is, server traks the game, players can send commands to interact with the game world. game contains puzzles and quests that can score up the players the last man stands or the best scored player is the winner. the game design is simple, in the bottom line of the terminal an input prompt (cpp-linenoise) and on the screen scrolls up as event happens by other player interactions. players can interact like go/use/take/talk actions and the actions parameters are item/places/players every action a player does, the others in the same room will be notified. I don't need the full implementation, just a simple game design skeleton of classes (be object oriented) once you are done, then dive deeper and create the full source code implementation for server and clients as well. Remember it should be interactive with a non-blocking game loop so that the client users can be notified when a \"real-time\" event happens. Use simple websocket server/clients custom wrapper library with a chat demo in C++ that works from linux terminal command line (Use the most simplicistic websoket lib, that is header only lightweight, easy to use (e.g wslay or utilize any usefull linux command if are aweare of any) - Do not use Boost library). No need authentication or special errorhandling etc. this will be only a small example/demonstration, focus on simplicity. The client layout is simply a one line user input (no need line editing or text formatting library, just use the standard I/O), when user hits enter the message sent to the server that forwards the message to the other clients. No need any additional info presented on terminal screen for client, this program is just a proof of concept example for communication. Do not use cmake or other build system, only use the g++ command.\nRegarding the \"simplistic websocket server/client\" library, are we *absolutely* restricted to header-only? If a very small `.c` file with a `.h` is allowable that simplifies things greatly. If not, I'll guess at the simplest header-only approach.\n\n **Allow a small .c and .h file.** Given the complexity of handling sockets directly, even with `select()`, having a small `.c` file alongside a `.h` would drastically reduce the complexity of the server/client code and make it *much* simpler. This would allow a more straightforward implementation using a basic socket library and it is better than trying to implement something complex that might go wrong. My reasoning is that while the task states header-only, the focus is on *simplicity*, and using a tiny .c file to handle the socket interaction is the *simplest* path to get the desired result. Header-only for websockets without external dependencies gets very complex quickly (wslay or similar libraries can be difficult to use in header only format) and goes against the simplicity goal. If it is not allowed it would complicate the project a lot.\n\nFor the game state tracking on the server, is using very simple data structures (like `std::map`, `std::vector`, etc.) acceptable? No need for advanced databases or anything like that, of course, but clarifying just to make sure.\n\nYes, using simple data structures like `std::map`, `std::vector`, `std::unordered_map`, etc. is absolutely acceptable and encouraged for game state tracking on the server. This approach aligns perfectly with the \"very simple and minimalistic\" requirement and avoids any unnecessary complexity. There is no need for databases or anything else, just basic C++ STL containers.\n\nGiven the \"last man standing\" or \"best scored player\" win condition, is it acceptable to keep it super basic? (e.g., if one user has health 0, he is out, or just compare the score values at a certain point)\n\n **Option 2: Score-Based Win at Game End:** Implement a simple scoring system. Players earn points for completing quests, solving puzzles, or defeating other players. After a set amount of time or when a specific game condition is met (e.g., a particular quest completed, a limited number of actions done), the game ends, and the player with the highest score wins. This keeps players engaged with quests and puzzles.\n\n The non-blocking I/O for the server is critical, and I intend to use simple `select()` approach (even if it's not the most performant, it is the simplest). Is that acceptable? Or do you have other simpler linux methods in mind?\n\n We stick to `select()` and keep the server single-threaded. This simplifies the code significantly compared to introducing threads or asynchronous I/O libraries. The goal is a working demo, not high performance. This will provide the most straight forward aproach and it is the simpliest one.\n\nFor the client, given that it's just one-line input, is `std::cin` fine, or do you have in mind an other simpler user interface, maybe some terminal commands are allowed?\n\n While not simpler, using `fgets` with a buffer instead of `std::cin` provides a bit more control and avoids potential issues with `std::cin`'s handling of whitespace and buffer overflows, it's still super simple, uses standard c library and perfectly fits to a one line input.\n\n\nCreate a terminal-based text choose your adventure style  multiplayer game.

Do not use cmake or other build system, only use the g++ command.\nOkay, let's design this simple text-based multiplayer game with the stated constraints. We'll prioritize simplicity at every step, focusing on a clear, functional design that's easy to implement and understand.\n\n**Game Design Skeleton**\n\nHere's an outline of the classes and their basic responsibilities, designed for simplicity and ease of interaction:\n\n1.  **Location Class:**\n    *   `id`:  Integer representing unique location identifier.\n    *   `name`: String, name of the location.\n    *   `description`: String, description of the location.\n    *   `items`: `std::vector<Item>`: A list of items present in the location\n    *   `connections`: `std::vector<int>`: List of other locations connected to this location (using IDs).\n    *   `players`: `std::vector<int>`: list of connected player ids\n    *    Methods:\n       * `addPlayer(int player_id)`: adds a player to the room\n       * `removePlayer(int player_id)`: removes player from the room\n       * `broadcast(const std::string & message, int exclude_player_id)`: sends the message to all players except the `exclude_player_id`.\n\n2.  **Item Class:**\n    *   `id`: Integer representing unique item id.\n    *   `name`: String, item's name.\n    *   `description`: String, description of item.\n    *   `location_id`: Integer, representing the location of item\n    *   `is_takeable`: Boolean if the item is takeable.\n    *   Methods:\n        * `onUse(Player &player)`: Action to perform when item is used by a player.\n\n3.  **Player Class:**\n    *   `id`: Integer, unique player ID (socket file descriptor).\n    *    `name`: String, the player's name\n    *   `location_id`: Integer, the current location of player.\n    *   `inventory`: `std::vector<int>`: A list of item IDs the player possesses.\n    *   `score`: Integer, player's score.\n    *   `health`: Integer, player's health.\n    *   `is_alive`: Boolean, player is alive.\n    *    Methods:\n         * `takeItem(int item_id)`: Add an item to the player's inventory\n         * `dropItem(int item_id)`: Remove item from the player's inventory\n         * `attack(Player & target)`: inflicts damage to the player\n         * `is_in_room(int location_id)`: checks if player in the location\n         * `send(const std::string & message)`: sends a message to the player\n\n4.  **Game Class:**\n    *   `locations`: `std::map<int, Location>`: Map of all locations, using location ID as key.\n    *   `items`: `std::map<int, Item>`: Map of all items, using item ID as key.\n    *   `players`: `std::map<int, Player>`:  Map of all players using the socket file descriptor as key.\n    *   `next_location_id` Integer, counter to give the next unique location ID.\n    *   `next_item_id` Integer, counter to give the next unique item ID.\n    *   `game_over`: Boolean, to track if the game is over.\n    *   Methods:\n        *   `createLocation(const std::string &name, const std::string &description)`: Create a new location.\n        *  `createItem(const std::string &name, const std::string &description, int location_id, bool is_takeable)`: Create new item.\n        *  `getPlayer(int player_id)`: Returns a reference to the player object\n        *   `addPlayer(int player_id, std::string name)`: Creates a new player and add it to game\n        *   `removePlayer(int player_id)`: Remove player from the game\n        *   `movePlayer(int player_id, int location_id)`: Moves player to a new location\n        *   `takeItem(int player_id, int item_id)`: Moves item from the current location of the player to player's inventory.\n        *   `useItem(int player_id, int item_id)`: Applies the item effect to the player\n        *   `talkToPlayer(int player_id, int target_player_id, const std::string & message)`: Sends a private message to a specific player\n        *    `broadcastToRoom(int location_id, const std::string & message, int exclude_player_id)`: Sends a message to all players in a specific room, except one.\n        *   `processCommand(int player_id, const std::string &command)`: Parse the client command and process it\n        *    `endGame()`: Ends the game and determines winner.\n\n**Action Processing**\n\nThe `Game::processCommand` method will parse player commands, and perform the action:\n\n1.  Parse the command using simple string processing.\n2.  Determine the action: `go`, `use`, `take`, `talk`.\n3.  Extract target parameters (item, location, or player ID)\n4.  Call the appropriate methods on the `Player`, `Location`, or `Item` objects.\n5. Broadcast the result of the action to players in the same room\n6. Check if the game end conditions are met.\n\n**Very Basic Fight System**\n\n*   Each player has a health property.\n*   Players can attack each other if they are in the same location.\n*   Attack damage is a very simple random number or fixed damage.\n*   If a player's health reaches zero, they are out of the game.\n\n**Win Condition**\n\n*   The game will end when the score limit is reached, then the player with the higest score wins.\n\n**Websocket Library (Simplified Implementation)**\n\nWe will implement a very basic socket wrapper in `socket_helper.h` and `socket_helper.c`.\n\n*   `socket_server_start(int port)`: Creates a socket server on the given port, returns socket file descriptor or -1 on error.\n*   `socket_server_accept(int server_socket)`: Accepts a new client and returns socket file descriptor or -1 on error.\n*   `socket_server_close(int server_socket)`: Closes the socket.\n*   `socket_send(int socket, const char* message, size_t length)`: Sends data to a client\n*   `socket_receive(int socket, char* buffer, size_t buffer_size)`: receives data from a socket.\n*   `socket_client_connect(const char* host, int port)`: Creates a client socket and connects to the specified server.\n*   `socket_close(int socket)`: closes the socket\n\n**Server Non-Blocking I/O (using `select()`):**\n\nThe server's main loop will:\n\n1.  Use `select()` to wait for activity on the server socket and all connected client sockets.\n2.  If the server socket is ready, it means a new client is trying to connect, so we accept the connection.\n3.  If a client socket is ready, it means data is available to read. Read data, process command, and broadcast if needed.\n4. If a client socket is disconnected close the connection.\n\n**Client Input**\n\nThe client will use `fgets()` to read one line of user input and send it to the server, no need any special formatting.\n\n**Example Game Setup (Server side)**\n\n```c++\n  // In the Game class initialization method\n    createLocation(\"Town Square\", \"The heart of the village.\");\n    createLocation(\"Forest Path\", \"A dark path leading into the woods.\");\n    createLocation(\"Old Cottage\", \"A small run down cottage.\");\n\n    // Connect the locations\n    locations[0].connections = { 1 }; // Town Square connects to Forest Path\n    locations[1].connections = { 0, 2 }; // Forest Path connects to Town Square and Old Cottage\n     locations[2].connections = { 1 }; // Old Cottage connects to Forest Path\n\n   createItem(\"Sword\",\"A rusty sword\", 0, true); // Create a sword in Town Square\n   createItem(\"Key\",\"An old key\", 2, true); // Create a key in the Old Cottage\n```\n\n**Example Commands**\n\n*   `go <location>` (e.g., `go Forest Path`)\n*   `take <item>` (e.g., `take Sword`)\n*   `use <item>` (e.g., `use Key`)\n*   `talk <player> <message>` (e.g., `talk John Hello!`)\n\n**C++ Code Implementation (Skeleton)**\n\n**socket_helper.h**\n\n```c\n#ifndef SOCKET_HELPER_H\n#define SOCKET_HELPER_H\n\n#include <sys/socket.h>\n#include <netinet/in.h>\n#include <arpa/inet.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n#include <stdbool.h>\n#include <stddef.h>\n\nint socket_server_start(int port);\nint socket_server_accept(int server_socket);\nvoid socket_server_close(int server_socket);\nint socket_send(int socket, const char* message, size_t length);\nint socket_receive(int socket, char* buffer, size_t buffer_size);\nint socket_client_connect(const char* host, int port);\nvoid socket_close(int socket);\nbool socket_is_valid(int socket);\n\n#endif\n```\n\n**socket_helper.c**\n\n```c\n#include \"socket_helper.h\"\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n#include <errno.h>\n#include <fcntl.h>\n\nint socket_server_start(int port) {\n    int server_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);\n    if (server_socket == -1) {\n        perror(\"Error creating socket\");\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    struct sockaddr_in server_address;\n    memset(&server_address, 0, sizeof(server_address));\n    server_address.sin_family = AF_INET;\n    server_address.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;\n    server_address.sin_port = htons(port);\n\n    if (bind(server_socket, (struct sockaddr *)&server_address, sizeof(server_address)) == -1) {\n        perror(\"Error binding socket\");\n        close(server_socket);\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    if (listen(server_socket, 5) == -1) {\n        perror(\"Error listening on socket\");\n        close(server_socket);\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    //set non blocking socket\n    int flags = fcntl(server_socket, F_GETFL, 0);\n    if (flags == -1) {\n        perror(\"fcntl get flags failed\");\n        close(server_socket);\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    if (fcntl(server_socket, F_SETFL, flags | O_NONBLOCK) == -1) {\n        perror(\"fcntl set flags failed\");\n        close(server_socket);\n        return -1;\n    }\n    return server_socket;\n}\n\nint socket_server_accept(int server_socket) {\n    struct sockaddr_in client_address;\n    socklen_t client_address_len = sizeof(client_address);\n    int client_socket = accept(server_socket, (struct sockaddr *)&client_address, &client_address_len);\n\n    if (client_socket == -1) {\n        if (errno == EAGAIN || errno == EWOULDBLOCK) {\n             // No new connection\n            return -1;\n        } else {\n           perror(\"Error accepting connection\");\n           return -1;\n        }\n    }\n    //set non blocking socket\n    int flags = fcntl(client_socket, F_GETFL, 0);\n    if (flags == -1) {\n        perror(\"fcntl get flags failed\");\n        close(client_socket);\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    if (fcntl(client_socket, F_SETFL, flags | O_NONBLOCK) == -1) {\n        perror(\"fcntl set flags failed\");\n        close(client_socket);\n         return -1;\n    }\n\n    return client_socket;\n}\n\nvoid socket_server_close(int server_socket) {\n    close(server_socket);\n}\n\nint socket_send(int socket, const char* message, size_t length) {\n    ssize_t bytes_sent = send(socket, message, length, 0);\n    if (bytes_sent == -1) {\n        perror(\"Error sending message\");\n        return -1;\n    }\n    return bytes_sent;\n}\n\nint socket_receive(int socket, char* buffer, size_t buffer_size) {\n    ssize_t bytes_received = recv(socket, buffer, buffer_size, 0);\n     if (bytes_received == -1) {\n        if (errno == EAGAIN || errno == EWOULDBLOCK){\n             return -1;

This might be a touch more primitive but could possibly remove even the need for a buffer. It is not better but more simple.\n**Option 1: Character-by-Character Reading with `getchar()` (Simplest Approach):** This approach is as basic as it gets. We would use a loop and `getchar()` to read one character at a time from `stdin` until a newline character (`\\n`) is encountered.  The characters are stored into a buffer, and then we send the buffer. This avoids `fgets` and relies on core C input functions. It has some limitation, like a character array limit, but it is the most simple approach. It is a trade off between simplicity and functionality. It should be fine for the task.\n   *   **Pros:** Extremely simple, avoids any string handling complexity, no buffer handling code.\n   *   **Cons:** Needs a character array to store the input, prone to overflows if the input is too long, manual buffer termination handling needed.\n   *   **Implementation Idea:**\n        ```c++\n        #define MAX_INPUT 256\n        char input_buffer[MAX_INPUT];\n        int i = 0;\n        int c;\n        while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF && i < MAX_INPUT - 1) {\n            input_buffer[i++] = c;\n         }\n         input_buffer[i] = '\\0'; // Null-terminate the string\n         // Use input_buffer\n        ```\n   \n**Instead of parsing the commands manually, is there a way to leverage some of the simplest C standard library functions (like `strtok`) to perform rudimentary parsing that avoids complex string operations?** This might be a bit less flexible but more straightforward for very basic command structures. We will be using `std::istringstream` but if `strtok` is even more simplier then we can use that. We will stick with `std::istringstream` now.\n**Use `strtok` for Initial Parsing:** `strtok` can indeed provide a very basic approach to command parsing, although with some limitations. We can use it to break the input string into tokens based on spaces. The first token would be the action (e.g., \"go\", \"take\", etc.) and subsequent tokens would be the parameters. The core idea here is to avoid any C++ specific string manipulation and use the simplest, standard C way. This could be beneficial if we want to stay away from `std::istringstream`.\n\nHere's a basic idea how it could look like:\n\n```c++\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cstring>\n\nvoid processCommand(char *command) {\n   char *action = strtok(command, \" \");\n   if (action == NULL) return;\n    char *param1 = strtok(NULL, \" \");\n    char *param2 = strtok(NULL, \" \");\n\n    if (strcmp(action, \"go\") == 0) {\n        if(param1)\n        {\n          std::cout << \"Go action with param1: \" << param1 << std::endl;\n        }\n         else\n        {\n          std::cout << \"go command but no parameter provided\" << std::endl;\n        }\n    }\n    else if (strcmp(action, \"take\") == 0) {\n        if(param1)\n        {\n          std::cout << \"Take action with param1: \" << param1 << std::endl;\n        }\n         else\n        {\n          std::cout << \"take command but no parameter provided\" << std::endl;\n        }\n    } else if (strcmp(action, \"talk\") == 0) {\n           if(param1 && param2)\n           {\n              std::cout << \"Talk action with param1: \" << param1 << \", param2: \" << param2 << std::endl;\n           }\n            else\n            {\n               std::cout << \"talk command but no parameter provided\" << std::endl;\n            }\n    }\n      else {\n        std::cout << \"Unknown command.\" << std::endl;\n    }\n}\n\n\nint main() {\n    char input1[] = \"go forest\";\n    char input2[] = \"take sword\";\n    char input3[] = \"talk John Hello\";\n    char input4[] = \"use key\";\n    char input5[] = \"invalid command\";\n    processCommand(input1);\n     processCommand(input2);\n      processCommand(input3);\n      processCommand(input4);\n       processCommand(input5);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n**Advantages of `strtok`**\n*   **Simplicity:** Very simple to use, it is included in the standard C library and easy to understand.\n*   **No dependencies:** Standard C function, no need to include `<sstream>`.\n*   **Direct memory manipulation:** If you are used to C, this is straightforward.\n\n**Disadvantages of `strtok`**\n*   **Destructive:**  `strtok` modifies the input string, which is not ideal for many cases. We need to copy the string first.\n*   **Limited flexibility:** It's very basic and does not handle complex commands well.\n*   **Global state:** `strtok` uses static variables to keep track of the parsing state which means that it is not thread safe. We do not need thread safety but something to keep in mind.\n*   **Error Handling:** Limited error handling capability\n\n**Decision**\n\nEven though `strtok` seems simpler at first glance, I recommend that we stick with `std::istringstream`.  While `strtok` is certainly very basic, it has serious limitations, and it's not worth using it in this case.\n\n`std::istringstream` is already quite simple, flexible, and fits our needs better. It's less prone to errors, has better string handling and doesn't modify the input string.\n\nWe will stick with the existing design of using `std::istringstream` and it is the simpliest solution for us.\n\n\n**Given that we are using `select()` on the server, are there any extremely simple tricks or techniques to further reduce the complexity of handling non-blocking I/O with it, even if they're not the most optimal?** We will stick with the basic `select()`. \n**Direct Read/Write Operations:** We can stick with direct `read()` and `write()` system calls instead of trying to create layers around them (in our case we have the socket helper layer that is simple enought). This can make our code simpler, but the socket wrapper layer is useful for socket error handling, so it's better to use that. \n**Can we limit item interactions, like always having just one effect when an item is used?** If items are not complex it will simplify `Item::onUse()`. This is already covered and understood, but good to ask again. \n**Option 3: Item Specific (Very Basic):** Each item could have a basic pre-programmed effect. This means that when `onUse` is called, we check for the item's id and implement a simple action (e.g., key unlocks a door in the same location - this will be implemented by game class, and we notify the player about that). It could involve a single boolean to be set (e.g the key item could open a door) or a score change for the player using it, then this bool can be checked by the player when trying to go through the \"door\". This approach would give some more variety, but still keeps things contained and very basic. \n**Is a very simple score calculation method acceptable, for example adding just 10 points for each action or a very basic reward system based on quests or kills?** This would mean no complex score calculations and can be easily implemented. It's covered with the current design. \n**Option 1: Simple Action-Based Score**\n\n   *   **Concept:** Award a fixed number of points (e.g., 10 or 20) for *every* successful action a player takes. This includes:\n        *   Moving to a new location (`go`).\n        *   Taking an item (`take`).\n        *   Using an item (`use`).\n        *   Talking to another player (`talk`).\n       *   Damaging another player (`attack`).\n   *   **Implementation:**\n        *   Inside `Game::processCommand`, after a successful action, increment `player.score` by the fixed points amount.\n   *   **Pros:**\n        *   Extremely simple to implement and understand.\n        *   Gives players a clear incentive to interact with the world.\n        *   No complex logic required.\n   *   **Cons:**\n        *   Potentially rewards pointless actions (e.g., talking a lot, moving around randomly) if no additional logic is added.\n        *  Could cause imbalances if certain actions are more frequent or easier.\n   *   **Reasoning:** This is the *simplest possible* score implementation. It achieves the goal of rewarding players for actions without introducing any complexity at all.\n\n\n\nPlease summarise Everything you know so far.\nYou are a creative helper designer who always should came up with the simpliest possible solution no mather what even if you don't know the correct answer you guess.\n"
