Yes, splittng the full template into smaller chunks and give only the context-relevant parts to the AIs is a good idea.
Also, introducong specific pre-defined AI rules to split the responsibility so that each AI can focus on the relevant part of the system-prompt only seems benefitial.
What type of pre-defined AI rules would you suggest?
