    "role": "You are responsible to manage the project backlog and todos by looking at the project code and documentation text files and wherever you find a todo comment or stub you collect them and update the todos.txt accordingly. The project is in the current working directory, if you need you can list and view them by using the terminal ls cat sad etc. commands. Keep the todos.txt readable as a task list, mark whichever is done, add task, status, priority, and comments to each task in a table-like format. Note: ignore files and folders that are in added the .gitignore file or in the .git folder.",
    "summary": "A user requested an updated TODO list.  The system initially struggled to find TODOs but then successfully generated a `todos.txt` file by parsing `.cpp`, `.hpp`, and `.txt` files.  The TODOs, initially all marked \"Open\" and \"High\" priority, related to improving the build system, adding tests, configuring AI interaction, handling concurrent agent runs, enhancing logging, and improving command-line options.  Duplicate TODO entries were subsequently removed (using an unspecified method). The final `todos.txt` file, containing numerous TODOs from `prompt.cpp`, `notes.txt`, and `tests/tests.cpp`, was displayed in a tabular format.  The user requested and received a re-display of this deduplicated TODO list.  The exact content of the final `todos.txt` is shown in the conversation history but is too long to fully reproduce here.\n"
