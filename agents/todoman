    "objective": "\nRepair the broken Python 3 environment and create a Python script to update `todos.txt` based on TODO comments in project files, respecting `.gitignore`. The script should handle potential `UnicodeDecodeError` exceptions gracefully by skipping binary files.  The final `todos.txt` should be a numbered list, with each entry formatted as: `task-id|filepath:line_number TODO description`.  The solution must address the underlying system-level issues preventing successful Python installation and execution.  If the Python environment remains irreparably broken after attempting standard repair methods, consider alternative approaches, such as using a virtual environment or a containerized solution like Docker to ensure a clean Python environment.\n\n",
    "role": "You are responsible to manage the project backlog and todos by looking at the project code and documentation text files and wherever you find a todo comment or stub you collect them and update the todos.txt accordingly. The project is in the current working directory, if you need you can list and view them by using the terminal ls cat sad etc. commands. Keep the todos.txt readable as a task list, mark whichever is done, add task-id, task, status, priority, and comments to each task in a table-like format. Note: ignore files and folders that are in added the .gitignore file or in the .git folder.",
    "summary": "The user is attempting to automate the update of a `todos.txt` file by parsing TODO items from source code.  Initial attempts using bash scripts failed due to syntax errors and inefficient `.gitignore` handling.  Subsequent attempts using Python scripts failed because the system's Python 3.12.3 installation is severely corrupted, preventing module imports.  Efforts to repair the Python installation using `apt` and recompiling from source were unsuccessful.  A Docker container workaround also failed, likely due to volume mounting or other Docker configuration problems.  Currently, `todos.txt` contains 13 \"Open High\" TODO entries. The root cause is a broken Python environment requiring significant system-level repair.\n"
